**********************************************************************************************************************************
The team of 6 students including me had participated in the internal Smart India Hackathon 2020. We had chosen the subject of the student grievance support system for the university. We had to make a website that will handle all grievances of students and the respective authorities can solve the grievance from the same platform. We have made it within 72 hours.

I with my team had participated in the internal Smart India Hackethon 2020 (SIH) with the problem statement of student grievance support system. We have developed this project within 72 hourse and became the winner in internal Smart India Hackethon 2020 by competing 150+ teams. We have developed the entire platform in 72 hours with the folloing key features.

 - The first thing is the user (i.e. student, teacher, parents) can make thier login on the pltform to submit the grievance. Without login they can't send the grievance. Also, the respective authority should be logged in to resolve the grievance.
 - After successful login, user have to build thier profile on the platform. Because after submitting the grievance the profile is also shared with the respective authority. So, he/she can resolve your grievance efficiently.
 - The all activities of the users are notified to the user via message and mails. Also, the user and authority can see the history of the user. Also, user can track thier grievance and can come to know in which state the grievance is.
 - The respective authority can heck the grievance and the shared files and can make the certain action on it. He/she can complete the grievance by sending the specific mesage and documents.
 - If the user is not satisfied with the solution then he can generate the same grievance by just one click. But the past activities will store in the history.
 - If the particular authority is not solving the problems and if the grievace will be their for 3-5 days in his login then he will get the notification on his mobile phone and mail. If then also, he is not solving the problems and the grievance is there more than five days then the higher authority will get a notification regarding the same, and then higher authority will look into it and solve the issue.
 - The authorities are divided into three big categories such as department, college, and the University. Again these are divide into different parts based on the grievance type. The user have to select the category of his/her grievance and accordingly it will go to respective authority. If the user will send it to the wrong authority, then authority can send it to the correct person.
 - Also, the authority can send the instructions or notices to the right audience automatically. The person who is at department level can send the notices to the students of his department only.


These are the features that we had made during the 72 hours. After submitting the project to the SIH authorities they have given the winner position to us among the 150+ teams. We have got a certificates from the vice chancellor of the university.
